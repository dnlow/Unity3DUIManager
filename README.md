# Unity3DUIManager
Unity implementation of a UIManager that manages all UI interactions via scripting

The UIManager basically handles all functionality involving a player opening and closing an "inventory" or a "Pause Menu" or a "Quest Journal"
When a player opens any of these menus using keyboard inputs, the game is paused and other menus are closed.
